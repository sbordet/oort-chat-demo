/**
 * <p>{@link RoomJoinService} performs the actions needed to join a particular user to a particular chat room.</p>
 * <p>Joining a room is subject to some checks, in particular that the user membership level implies the room
 * membership level.</p>
 * <p>Both {@link UserInfo} and {@link RoomInfo} have the membership information, and this implies that the
 * checks can be performed locally in any node, no matter if the node owns the room or if it owns the user.</p>
 * <p>If, for example, {@link RoomInfo} did not have the membership information, we would have needed to forward
 * the join action to the node that owned the room (which would have had the membership information locally).</p>
 * <p>Because joining a room is local to a node, {@link RoomLeaveService} must work locally too.</p>
