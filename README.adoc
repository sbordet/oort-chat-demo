== Distributed Oort Chat Demo

This is an implementation of a chat application distributed over multiple nodes based on http://cometd.org[CometD]
3.0.0 and its http://docs.cometd.org/reference/java_oort.html[clustering functionalities].

It is a showcase for the new clustering functionalities added since CometD 2.7.0: `OortObject` (and subclasses)
and `OortService` (and subclasses).

=== Building & Running the Demo

Assuming the project root directory is the $DEMO directory, the code can be easily run in multiple nodes
using the Maven Jetty Plugin in this way:

    $ cd $DEMO
    $ mvn jetty:run -PA

This will start the profile "A", which starts the first node on port 8080, called node "A".
You don't need to build the demo first, as the Jetty Maven Plugin does this already.

Wait until the first node is fully started, then you can start the second node in this way (on another terminal window):

    $ cd $DEMO
    $ mvn jetty:run -PB

This will start the profile "B", which starts the second node on port 9090, called node "B".

Now you can hit the two nodes with two browsers, one pointing at http://localhost:8080 and the other
pointing to http://localhost:9090.

=== Code Overview

The "entry point" is `StartupServlet` where the various services are created and configured.
In particular, `StartupServlet` also loads the id of the current node, specified in `web.xml`
with the `<init-param>` "node".

This allows each node to load node-specific files that contains the node id in the file name.
For example, each node loads a file that contains chat rooms that must exist at startup - see `rooms-A.json`.

Each service performs exactly one task.

==== `UsersService`

This service is responsible for creating a `UserInfo` instance every time a user logs in, and delete that
instance when the user logs out or expires.
To do so, it register itself as a `BayeuxServer.SessionListener` to be notified of user login/logout.

`UserInfo` instances are distributed across nodes using an `OortMap<String, UserInfo>` that maps the user id
with its `UserInfo` instance. In this way, every node has the `UserInfo` about all users from all nodes.

When user A1 logs in in nodeA, `UsersService` creates a `UserInfo`, puts it into the `OortMap` which replicates
it to other nodes. Likewise, when user B1 logs in in nodeB `UsersService` replicates its `UserInfo` to nodeA.

==== `RoomsService`

This service is responsible for maintaining the list of chat rooms, so users can choose which room they want
to join.
It is composed of an `OortMap<String, RoomInfo>` that maps the room id to its `RoomInfo` instance.
In this way, every node has the `RoomInfo` about all the rooms from all nodes.

This service only manages the room list; creating, deleting, joining or leaving a room is handled by other
specific services. This service only pushes the room list to clients.

`RoomsService` loads each node's rooms at startup, reading a node-specific file that contains the rooms for
that node.

More rooms may be created at runtime. The creation is handled by a specific service that call this service
to add the new room and to make sure it's pushed to the client's room list.
When a room is created in a node and its `RoomInfo` replicated to other nodes, all `RoomsService` instances
in all nodes receive a "put event" for their `OortMap` of rooms.

When these events are received by `RoomService`, it calls the `RoomMembersService` to create/destroy a member
list for that room on the current node.

==== `RoomMembersService`

This service is responsible for maintaining the room members list updated for each room.
It is composed of a `ConcurrentMap<RoomInfo, OortList<UserInfo>>`, so a non-distributed map with `OortList`
distributed values.
The non-distributed map contains entries for all rooms in all nodes, thanks to the fact that `RoomService`
notifies this service every time a room is created/destroyed.

This service is being called by the `RoomJoinService` and by the `RoomLeaveService` every time a user joins
or leaves a room. Furthermore, it register itself as a listener to `UsersService` so that every time a user
disconnects without explicitly leaving the rooms it joined, `RoomMembersService` can remove the user from
the rooms it joined.

For any change in the members list of a room, this service broadcasts a message across the cluster that is delivered to remote clients via standard Oort features.

==== `RoomJoinService` & `RoomLeaveService`

These services are responsible for join/leave a user to/from a room.
They listen for messages from remote clients and perform the action.

As the room may not be local to the node that is performing the join, this service delegates to the
`RoomsService` to find the `RoomInfo` correspondent to the room the user wants to join.
Since `RoomsService` maintains the ``RoomInfo``s for all rooms in all nodes, the lookup happens locally.

These services communicate with the `RoomMembersService` to notify it that the user joined/left the room so that the room's member list can be kept up to date.

`RoomJoinService` performs a check to see whether the user has the rights to join the room.
This check can be done locally because both `RoomInfo` and `UserInfo` carry the information needed to perform the check.

==== `RoomCreateService`

This service is responsible for creating new rooms at runtime upon user demand.
In order to create a room, a unique across the cluster id must be generated.
`RoomCreateService` uses an `OortPrimaryLong` as a the id generator; when the unique id is generated and sent back to the node that wants to create the room, this service creates the new `RoomInfo` and passes it to the `RoomsService` to distribute the new `RoomInfo` across all nodes.

==== `ChatService`

This service is responsible for handling chat messages from remote clients, and re-broadcast them to all nodes, possibly after text modifications or other actions (like warning a user for bad wording in messages).

Chat messages are re-broadcast across all nodes using standard Oort features.

Every chat message is archived with the help of the `ChatHistoryArchiveService`.

==== `ChatHistoryService`, `ChatHistoryArchiveService` & `ChatHistoryRequestService`

These services work together to provide a storage for chat messages for every room.

There exist one instance of `ChatHistoryService` per each node.
`ChatHistoryService` does not use any Oort features, it just hosts a `ConcurrentMap<Long, ChatHistoryInfo>`
that maps the room id to the history of messages for that room.

Every time a chat message must be archived, `ChatHistoryArchiveService` finds the node that owns the room
and forwards the archive action using `OortService` features.
In this way, the chat history for a room only resides on the node that owns the room, and it is not distributed
across all the nodes.
Similarly, `ChatHistoryRequestService` retrieves the last messages on the chat room by first finding the node
that owns the room, and then forwarding the retrieve action using `OortService` features.
